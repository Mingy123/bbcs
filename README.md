# K-Tryon

This project is submitted to BBCS 2023 (BuildingBloCS).

K-Tryon is an e-commerce app consisting of different AI programs.  With K-Tryon, you can try on clothing online with immense precision, using [VITON-HD](https://github.com/shadow2496/VITON-HD) _(Choi, Seunghwan and Park, Sunghyun and Lee, Minsoo and Choo, Jaegul)_. K-Tryon also implements a neural network for recommendation for clothing that the user will potentially buy, based on their existing purchase history. With this project, we aim to boost online sales by providing a better user experience when shopping for clothes online.

This app consists of a full blown shopping platform, where users can sign up for a user account and make purchases and payments under it. Upon entering the app, the user is presented with a list of recommendations. They can then select an item and upload an image for VIRTUAL Tryon, and check back in a while later to see their rendered images. For privacy reasons, users can only see their own images.
